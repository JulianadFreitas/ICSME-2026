      "message": "Add option to ignore type information\n\nSome vendors provide broken type information or type lookup replies, or\nthey do it properly but run into Cyclone's limited type lookup\nimplementation. This commit adds an option to completely ignore the\n\"type information\" parameter in discovery from specified vendors. If you\nknow that matching on type name is equivalent to performing the\nassignability check in the system, this can save the day.\n\nThe direct reason is I could not find a decent workaround for various\nproblems with the Fast-DDS version used by ROS2 late 2025 (commit\n33bb952a0e80e2b158571cb2d64ed6b2003609db on the 3.2.x branch), which set\nTRY_CONSTRUCT incorrectly on collection elements and responded to type\nlookup requests for a minimal type with a complete type but without the\nrequired complete-to-minimal identifier mapping and so any attempt at\nconverting from a complete type object to a minimal will fail.\n\nThe latter could be mitigated by switching to using complete type\nobjects for assignability checks if the response to a request for a\nminimal type object was a complete type object and properly loading\ndependent types. Those are valuable improvements, but bring their own\ncomplications.\n\nIt also turns out that Fast-DDS didn't request the types from Cyclone,\nand therefore can't be performing the assignability check to begin\nwith. All-in-all adding a setting to ignore the TYPE_INFORMATION is a\npragmatic choice to get things working.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

P deaf! P'\" hangs on the second \"deaf!\" while\n  waiting for the domain 1 to remove the proxy participant for P from the\n  table with recently deleted participant GUIDs (in test_oneliner.c, function\n  wait_for_cleanup)\n\nThe first of those can theoretically happen in application code as well if proxy\nparticipant lease expiry happens at just the right time while the discovery thread is\ncreating a new proxy entity for it. The likelihood of that is, of course, rather low: the\nreception of the discovery message triggering the creation of the new endpoint also\nrenewed the lease, and so the discovery thread would have to be delayed by a fair bit\nwhile the lease would have to be unusually short. But it is still possible.\n\nnew_proxy_{reader,writer} checks whether the proxy participant is still accessible via the\nhash table and if it is not being deleted yet. If both conditions apply, it adds an entry\nto the list of endpoints and increments the proxy participant's reference count. Only once\nthe proxy endpoint is fully initialized does it add it to the hash table.\n\nOn the other hand, ddsi_delete_participant_by_guid removes the proxy participant from the\nhash table, marks it as deleted, collects all the endpoint GUIDs and then deletes the\nendpoints by looking up the GUID and triggering deletion. So if it runs between the two\nsteps in creating a proxy endpoint mentioned above, it won't trigger deletion of the\nendpoint being created.\n\nAfter that, there is nothing triggering the deletion of the proxy endpoint anymore (an\napplication one could possibly still beleted, as it is still in the hash table, but that\nrequires receiving a dispose message, so there is still no guarantee). A built-in one will\ncertainly remain (but is only susceptible to the problem when triggered by oneliner, not\nby lease expiration).\n\nThus, the final stage of the proxy participant cleanup doesn't occur, it remains in the\n\"deleted participants\" table and its lease remains on the books.\n\nThis addresses the problem by making sure the work ddsi_delete_proxy_participant_by_guid\ntried to do is completed by ddsi_new_proxy_{reader,writer}."

When creating a new\nentity, it is always inserted in the hash table and then in the AVL tree; when deleting\nit, it is removed from the AVL tree and then from hash table.\n\nLocal entity creation can be on any thread, but these can only be deleted by the\napplication itself, via `dds_delete`, this requires the handle, this in turn requires the\nAPI function to have returned, &c. Thus, it must have been a proxy entity.\n\nProxy entities are created by the \"dq.builtin\" thread, and deletion is triggered by the\n\"dq.builtin\" thread, the \"gc\" thread on lease expiry, on shutdown (but this after stopping\nreading from the network and letting the \"dq.builtin\" thread run out) and by weird test\ncode, such as what \"oneliner\" does when marking a participant deaf and forcing lease\nexpiry.\n\nClearly, the \"dq.builtin\" thread alone cannot be the culprit: it handles the events\nsequentially and so the creation of an entity must have completed before starting the\ndeletion of it. The other threads only ever trigger deletion.\n\nLease expiry can only happen for proxy participants, and the lease is registered after the\nentity index has been updated. So lease expiry is also not a possible causes (absent\nmemory corruption or similar).\n\nHowever, \"oneliner\" itself creates the participants and on executing the \"deaf!\" command\nit immediately triggers deletion of all proxy participants it created. This therefore\nraces discovery and can pass the guarding check on presence of the GUID in the entity hash\ntable. This is therefore a possible path for hitting that particular assert.\n\nThis fixes the problem by first inserting the entry in the AVL tree, and only then in the\nhash table. It also removes the need for the vague \"lock\" in \"struct ddsi_domaingv\" that\nmade the delete operations atomic with respect to each other. That is now handled by\nchecking the insertion in the \"deleted participant GUID\" table for (proxy) participants,\nand by combining the lookup and the delete from the HASH table.\n\nThis commit also removes the scary FIXME:\n\n    FULL LOCKING AROUND NEW_XXX FUNCTIONS, JUST SO EXISTENCE TESTS ARE PRECISE\n\nit referred to the existence test that code relies on - presence in the hash table - and\nthe fact that this does not imply that the test says: entity exists and initialization is\ncompleted, or: the entity doesn't exist and deinitialization is completed. It has never\nbeen like that, and after a decade or so there doesn't appear to be a need to change this.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

The type's key will become the key of any DDS Topic that\n  is constructed using the aforementioned aggregated type as the Topic's\n  type. If a given type has no members designated as key members, then\n  the type -- and any DDS Topic that is constructed using it as its type\n  it -- has no key.  Key members shall never be optional, and they shall\n  always have their \"must understand\" attribute set to true.\n\nAs there are no exceptions given, this applies to the TypeObjects and to\nthe parameter headers in mutable encoding. It also means that there\nshould be no difference in TypeObject between S0 and S1:\n\n  struct S0 { @key long x; };\n  struct S1 { @must_understand @key long x; };\n\nMost implementations get this wrong, but a difference in \"must\nunderstand\" is not enough to fail an assignability check if both sides\nrecognize the field (and for key fields, they must).\n\nIt now turns out that RTI rejects XCDR1 mutable data if it contains key\nfield in with the \"must understand\" flag set where RTI didn't expect it.\nPerhaps they'll fix it, but for interoperability with broken versions,\nwe have to generate XCDR1 without setting the flag for key fields that\nare not marked as \"must understand\" in the IDL.  That means the\ngenerated opcodes for the serializer must not include the flag, and that\nmeans we have to leave it unset in the TypeObject.\n\n(We continue to set the flag in mutable XCDR2.)\n\nAnd so Cyclone joins the other implementations in getting it wrong ...\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

The\n  reason is that these are the only types that support defining key members and can\n  therefore be used to model Topics that contain multiple data-instances.\n\nOne can reasonably conclude that this forbids a typedef to a struct/union as the topic\ntype. On the other hand, the argument given doesn't apply to typedefs. Moreover, the spec\nsays about typedefs:\n\n  7.2.2.4.2 Alias Types\n\n  Alias types introduce an additional name for another type.\n\nand in Table 6 (same section):\n\n  Alternative name for another type.\n\n  An alias type—also referred to as a typedef from its representation in IDL, C, and\n  elsewhere—applies an additional name to an already-existing type. Such an alternative\n  name can be helpful for suggesting particular uses and semantics to human readers,\n  making it easier to repeat complex type names for human writers, and simplifying certain\n  language bindings.\n\n  As in the C and C++ programming languages, an alias/typedef does not introduce a\n  distinct type. It merely provides an alternative name by which to refer to the same\n  type.\n\nWhich says it is the same type under a different name, and so arguably a typedef to a\nstruct/union should be allowed.\n\nCommon sense says that it makes the most sense to allow it.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>\n\n* Check for unresolved types when unwrapping ALIAS\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>\n\n---------\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

This would probably involve setting additional globals\n  or requiring a differently named constructor.\n\n- Not exactly promise that a SERVICE_NAME will be present, do a trial\n  construction without it present, and then destruct/re-construct if it\n  turns out to be version 1 after all.\n\n- Guarantee a lookup of the SERVICE_NAME in the config string (using the\n  provided lookup function) will always succeed, even if the\n  SERVICE_NAME appears to not be present.\n\n- Just pass in the SERVICE_NAME, there are very few implementations of\n  the interface around anyway.\n\nThe third is the one requiring the least effort from anyone using the\ninterface and is what this commit implements.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

This is somewhat weird: the socket\ntriggers because data is available and so a read should return something.  IIRC it is\nthere because with OpenSSL 3 and TCP+TLS I saw received bytes all getting consumed\ninternally by OpenSSL during a handshake.  Anyway, it exists.\n\nCase 3 is for all errors.  The \"*rcvd untouched or set to 0\" was important because\nddsi_udp_conn_read would first check whether it is > 0.  It initializes it to 0, so if it\nis untouched on error or set to 0, all is well.\n\nThe one caller of ddsi_udp_conn_read is ddsi_receive.c:do_packet, which simply ignores any\ncall to ddsi_udp_conn_read that returns <= 0.  So case 2 can be propagated by returning\n0 (successful spurious read) or < 0 (error) without any difference in behaviour.\n\nThis requirement on *rcvd in case of an error is an accident waiting to happen.

It does not support statically linking\nIDLC because that would at best only support the C binding, but not other language\nbindings.  The recommendation for a static linked Cyclone is to build it as if it were a\ncross build to the native platform, that way the IDLC complications are avoided.\n\nAlmost all the changes are in the build system, only the \"dlopen\" functions in ddsrt are\nmodified to consult a table of compiled-in plugins first and some security tests need a\nsmall change in the specification of the security plugin wrapper libraries.\n\nThe build system defines a global CMake property \"plugin_list\" containing a list of all\nthe plugins to include, each plugin P defines a global \"P_symbols\" property that lists all\nthe symbols to be exported from the library.  The modified \"dlopen\" functionality consults\nthe table of plugins, the modified \"dlsym\" functionality consults the list of exported\nsymbols.\n\nThese properties are translated to macros on compiler command-line into comma-separated\nlists of plugin names (PLUGINS) and symbol names (PLUG_SUMBOLS_P for plugin P).  The\nmacros are then expanded into static tables of names and addresses by the C preprocessor.\n\nFor a static build, the plugins are defined as OBJECT libraries, \"installed\" because\nthat's the only way I have found so far to keep CMake happy with the references, and\npulled into the Cyclone library using the aforementioned properties.  For example:\n\n  if(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS)\n    add_library(dds_security_ac SHARED ${sources} ${private_headers})\n  else()\n    add_library(dds_security_ac OBJECT ${sources} ${private_headers})\n    set_property(GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY cdds_plugin_list dds_security_ac)\n    set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY dds_security_ac_symbols init_access_control finalize_access_control)\n  endif()\n\nThe other changes are then to only link the plugin against \"ddsc\" if building as a shared\nlibrary and, sometimes, adding a bunch of include paths because it won't work otherwise.\n\nIn a static build, the tests for PSMX that rely on the Cyclone-based plugin are disabled\nbecause of the complications that introduces.  Those tests do run if Iceoryx is available.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

      "message": "Fix raw sample/cdr confusion in loans\n\nThere were various issues causing confusion in the contents and size of\nloans:\n\n* dds_write_impl performed a look-ahead and could decide to allocate\n  memory for a PSMX loan, only taking into account the type to decide\n  whether to allocate based on the raw sample size or the serialized size,\n  but failing to account for the possibility of a serialized key value.\n\n* What used to be the \"force serialization\" flag was interpreted by\n  serdata_default as (also) requiring that the data in a loan would be in\n  serialized form, even though that wasn't the case.  It will handle\n  serialized data just fine even if it is not necessary, but there is no\n  reason for serializing it into shared memory if the data can just be\n  memcpy'd around.\n\n* This resulted in serdata_default using slightly different rules for\n  deciding whether or not to serialize and so could (attempt to) put\n  serialized data in a loan allocated for a raw sample.\n\n  The metadata would be set correctly, and the amount of memory copied\n  was that of the destination buffer, so as long as the CDR was no\n  longer than the raw sample (unlikely) and the serdata buffer happened\n  to be large enough, it was ok.  But those conditions are not always\n  satisfied.\n\nTaken together, this meant: out-of-bounds reads and inefficiencies.\n\nThis commit refactors dds_write_impl, taking the burden of doing things\nwith the contents of the loans from the serdata implementation (it\nleaves the interface unchanged), instead doing it in dds_write_impl\nwhere all the relevant information is available.\n\nThere was also some confusion in the handling of loans of complex types,\nwhere the application would be given a heap loan but the serdata\nimplementation did not handle this correctly throughout.  The code now\nsupports it properly.  Note that returning a heap loan even for a PSMX\nwriter is deliberate: this way, the types, memory allocation routines\nand lifetimes to be used for any reference in the type is independent of\nthe use of PSMX plugins.\n\nIt also moves the publishing via PSMX to *before* the network part.\nThis ensures that the latency via shared memory is not affected by the\nspeed with which the network can absorb the data.\n\nIn this refactored version, supporting zero-copy within the process (and\nwithout PSMX) was missing.

      "message": "Fix timed-event lockup on pre-emptive ACKNACKs\n\nThere was a case in which the ACKNACK generation event generating\npre-emptive ACKNACKs could continually get rescheduled for the same\ntime, causing the timed-event mechanism to spin generating those\npre-emptive ACKNACKS but without otherwise making progress. When certain\nconditions change externally, it continues normal operation:\n\n* reception of a heartbeat from the writer to which it is sending\n  pre-emptive ACKNACKs (by virtue of switching to regular ACKNACKs);\n\n* deletion of that proxy writer corresponding to that writer;\n\n* deletion of the reader;\n\nThe issue is that discovery matches the two and creates a struct\nddsi_rd_pwr_match, it sets the time stamp of creation.  This time may\nlay in the future of the time at which the ACKNACK event is initially\nscheduled, because the creation time is taken from the clock directly,\nwhereas the initial schedule time is taken from the approximate time\nstamp passed into ddsi_proxy_writer_add_connection.\n\nSo on executing the ACKNACK event handler, the current time passed into\nthe handler may lay before the creation time.  The \"time of last\nack\" (t_last_ack) gets set to this time and the event gets rescheduled\nfor t_last_ack + new_intv, where new_intv = 0 if it precedes the\ncreation time.\n\nThe timed event handler caches the current time, updating it only when\nit is known more than a trivial amount of time may have passed.  Rightly\nor wrongly, executing a timed-event doesn't cause the clock to be read\nagain, and so the first event in the queue is the event it just\nexecuted, and it immediately executes it again, in exactly the same\nstate.\n\nAmong the consequences are the obvious one of not processing any events\nscheduled for a later time, but also not sending out any retransmit\nqueued by the receive path as well as discovery messages queued for\ntransmission.\n\nThere are multiple contributing factors here:\n\n* It is daft to set the creation time to a later time than the initial\n  schedule.\n\n* It is, arguably, unwise to cache the time so aggressively. This\n  originates in the cost of reading the clock in older systems. This is\n  presumably still the case in various embedded systems, so at least\n  there is a decent argument for it.\n\nBut the root cause in my view is the fact that it can reschedule the\nevent for the same time.\n\nAll timestamps are in [0, INT64_MAX ns), so deleting the special case of a\ncurrent time that precedes the creation time does not introduce signed\ninteger overflow.\n\nFor times in [0,1s) it can potentially delay the transmission of the\ninitial pre-emptive ACKNACK by 1s. It is exceedingly unlikely that it\nwill ever need to send one in that interval, and even more unlikely that\nit affects anything, because the writer will be sending heartbeats as\nwell.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

In\r\ncase the union type is used for an external or mutable member,\r\nthis could lead to reading uninitialize sample data when re-using\r\nallocated sample data over multiple reads. E.g. in this data type:\r\n\r\n@final @nested\r\nunion u switch(octet) {\r\n    case 1:\r\n        // sequence<string>  u1;\r\n        sequence<string<3> >  u1;\r\n    default:\r\n        string d;\r\n};\r\n\r\n@mutable\r\nstruct s {\r\n    u f1;\r\n};\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the issue by introducing a sample-data-state\r\nparameter in the read (deserialize) functions in cdrstream, and\r\nensures that sample data is only read when the data state is\r\n'initialized'. In case of switching cases for a union, the state\r\nfor the sample data in that context is set to 'uninitialized',\r\nso that the deserializer doesn't read the data (e.g. to check if\r\na pointer needs to be released) for nested types; in that case it\r\nwill just allocate the memory and assume releasing it is not\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe DDS_TOPIC_CONTAINS_UNION is not used anymore and removed from\r\nthe IDLC generator.

      "message": "Fix type-info and type-map construction in dynamic type API\n\nThis fixes a number of issues in the construction of type-info\nand type-map objects in the type library, related to the dynamic\ntype API:\n\n- dds_dynamic_type_t now has a pointer to both the complete and the\n  minimal DDSI type, so that refcounting for the minimal types can\n  also be done correctly. Minimal types are inserted in the type library\n  when registering a dynamic type, when the type-info object is created.\n  When the minimal DDSI type pointer is not NULL, the refcount for the\n  minimal top-level DDSI type for a dynamic type is also updated when\n  updating the dynamic type refcount in the same way the complete type's\n  refc is updated.\n\n- The unused function ddsi_type_pair_minimal_info is removed; a type-\n  info object can only be fully generated from a complete DDSI type.\n  ddsi_type_pair_complete_info is renamed to ddsi_type_pair_get_typeinfo.\n\n- The dynamic type implementation did not hold the typelib lock in\n  certain cases; this is fixed in this commit. Additionally, locking is\n  added in ddsi_type_get_typeinfo_ser, ddsi_type_get_typemap_ser\n  and ddsi_type_pair_get_typeinfo\n\n- Getting the list of dependent types for type-info and type-map\n  construction was not taking the element type of plain-collection\n  types into account and not handling nested hashed types correctly.\n  This commit has a refactored implementation for both that resolves\n  these issues. For getting the type-map, the entries are now also\n  de-duplicated.\n\nSigned-off-by: Dennis Potman <dennis@zettascale.tech>"

In the case of a local write, we know we have the sample in\nmemory somwhere, even if the chunk contains the serialized\nrepresentation.

The problem is a need to avoid\n  races with the garbage collector which makes it impossible to store\n  the pointer to an entity without introducing additional stages in the\n  deletion process.  This in turn forces an additional indirection in\n  the \"old\" callbacks.\n\n* The internal functions heavily relied on the availability of a \"gv\"\n  pointer, this could easily be emulated via the closure argument, but it\n  seems to make more sense to pass it as an argument.\n\nThis allows moving a lot of handler code to more reasonable places,\nwhich in turn made \"ddsi_discovery\" explode too messy to survive without\nsplitting it.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

In\nprinciple, this is interoperable with other implementations, but it\nturns out that for the type discovery protocol (at least for OpenDDS)\nthis can result in dropping the first request, which (at least for\nOpenDDS) stalls type discovery and prevents matching.\n\nHence b6dadb3439d82412b2a7492ce31017960fbb3beb changed it to accept data\nfrom other DDS implementations before a heartbeat is received.  This\nmeans there may be gaps in the data sequence on starting up the reliable\nsession if the writer is using another DDS implementation.  If this is a\nproblem, just use Cyclone DDS.\n\nWhat did not change is that it expects to start at sequence number 1,\nand it is the first heartbeat that changes that expectation.  So if,\nfrom that other DDS implementation, the first data arrives before the\nfirst heartbeat and it has sequence numbers > 1, it will now be buffered\nand (likely) made available on receipt of the heartbeat.\n\nThe processing of the first heartbeat remained unchanged.  This means\nthere may be data ready for delivery where the code asserts that there\ncannot be any.  The assert in itself fortunately disappears in a release\nbuild (so there is no crash), but it does leak some memory.\n\nWith this commit the code is restructed to always use the \"regular\" code\npath for delivery of data to avoid duplication of the delivery code.\nThe downside is that the (correct) assert in the case of a Cyclone\nwriter had to be removed.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

This liveliness setting is then also propagated into\nthe built-in topics.\n\nThis does result in a change in behaviour for those applications that\ncreate a single QoS object containing a liveliness setting that they\nthen use for creating the participant and a reader/writer.

      "message": "Implementation of the XTypes type system in DDSI\n\nThis commit contains the implementation of the XTypes type system in DDSI. This replaces\nthe current implementation that is using proprietary type identifiers (a hash of a serialized\nsertype) and sends serialized sertypes in discovery data. The new implementation uses the\nType Identifier and Type Objects as defined in the DDS XTypes specification.\n\n- The type meta-data library is restructured and partly re-implemented, so that it can\n  handle minimal and complete type identifiers and their corresponding type objects.\n- The type lookup service endpoints are now using request and response types that\n  comply with the XTypes specification.\n- The implementation of the assignability check is based on the rules as defined in the XTypes\n  specification and uses the (discovered) type identifier and (minimal or complete) type\n  object to check the assignability of types used by the endpoints.\n- The IDL compiler C backend is extended with a module that outputs type meta-data as part\n  of the generated topic descriptor. Including the type meta-data can be disabled using the\n  '-t' command line option. The descriptors gets two XCDR2 blobs:\n    - serialized TypeInformation, which contains the type identifier (minimal and complete)\n      of the top-level type and its dependent type identifiers.\n    - serialized TypeMap, which maps the type identifiers used in the TypeInformation to\n      the TypeObjects.\n- Discovery data now contains the type information parameter (id 0x0075), which replaces\n  the proprietary parameter that was used in the old implementation.\n\nOpen issues and unsupported features:\n- The conversion from a (complete) type object to a sertype is not implemented\n  yet. As a result, it is not possible to create a topic based on a discovered\n  type and topic discovery for remote topics (find_topic functions) is not working.\n- Strongly connected components are not supported, and therefore recursive types\n  cannot be used with type-id/object generation enabled in the IDL compiler.\n- Missing support for specific xtypes features:\n  - explicit defaults (@default annotation) for members of aggregated types\n  - try-construct annotation\n  - extensibility 'mutable' for union and bitmask types\n  - map and bitset data-types\n  - inheritance for unions and bitset types\n  - must-understand annotation\n  - @external annotation on collection element type\n  - using struct, union, array (with non-primitive element type), sequence type\n    members as (part of the) key\n  - built-in annotations min, max, unit\n  - verbatim annotations\n\nSigned-off-by: Dennis Potman <dennis.potman@adlinktech.com>"

But it is now also possible to\nspecify min=default and max=4MB to request a 4MB buffer but continue\nwith whatever is the result after the setsockopt call.\n\nNote that some operating systems will set the buffer size to the maximum\nallowed if a larger buffer size is requested while some others return an\nerror and leave it unchanged (macOS is one of those). This error is\nignored as long as the resulting buffer size is larger than the minimum.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

This commit\n      adds support to the cdrstream serializer for writing CDR in LE format, in addition\n      to the existing write functions that are using native endianness.\n\n- Changes in the idl compiler front-end and C backend, to support all idl language\n  features that are used in the XTypes idl descriptions of type object, type identifiers,\n  and type lookup service request and response types.\n    - Add support for forward declarations for structs and union types, to support\n      recursive types.\n    - Add support for the bitmask type (note that the same version of this code is also\n      included in an earlier PR)\n    - Support external data (see below for more details\n    - @id annotation support (e.g. used for appendable and mutable types)\n    - prevent empty structs in output types (because the C99 spec and MSVC don't allow it)\n    - Add support for @extensibility, @final, @appendable, @mutable annotations, and\n      generate the serialization VM instruction according to a type's extensibility.\n    - Add support for bounded strings as pointers, enum maximum value,\n      the EXT type instruction, the key offset list (DDS_OP_KOF)\n\nSome features are missing or not fully implemented in this commit. This list below\nlists some of these, and also includes some known-issues in this implementation:\n- The must-understand annotation is not fully implemented\n- Explicit default values are not supported\n- IDLC should check if a key member is 'must-understand' and non-optional\n- Built-in member annotations (min, max, unit) are not supported\n- Verbatim annotations are not supported\n- The EMHEADER length code could be optimized for certain types (use 5-7 instead of 4,\n  see XTypes spec section 7.4.3.4.2)\n- Optimize for reading PL_XCDR2 members sequentially\n- Test cases should be added for interoperability with CDR1 nodes\n- Remove some code duplication in cdrstream (e.g. extract key functions)\n- Implement idl_case_label_intvalue for non-integer types (enum, char, octet, bool)\n\nSigned-off-by: Dennis Potman <dennis.potman@adlinktech.com>"

That roughly means every single time a reader history cache is\nupdated, the subscriber status has to be manipulated as well.\n\nIt turns out that this has a significant performance impact once one\nallows the statuses to remain set even when invoking the listener, so\nthat one can have listeners that monitor without any side-effects.\n(Significant here is 3.02MS/s -> 2.95MS/s in ddsperf -TOU pub/sub test\non my laptop, and the significane is perhaps more in sinking below 3MS/s\nthan in any absolute terms!)\n\nThis commit addresses that be only materializing the DATA_ON_READERS\nstate when the subscriber is attached to a waitset, and returning an\napproximation of it when querying the subscriber's status.

      "message": "Allow a sertype to request keyhashes in messages\n\nThis commit adds a vendor-specific parameter to the discovery parameters\nthat allows a reader to request the writers generate a \"keyhash\", also\nimplementing the mechanics of letting a sertype determine whether this\nis set, tracking the number of proxy readers requesting it in a writer,\nand generating the keyhash if at least one reader requests it (or if the\nold global override is set, or if DDS security requires it be\ngenerated).\n\nMaking the keyhash (if included) available to serdata_from_ser is the\nsubject of another commit (arguably an independent one, as the keyhash\nmay be available also if not requested).\n\nThere exist *some* legitimate cases of using a keyhash and that is the\nreason this is added.  Anyone contemplating using them should take some\nspecification mishaps into consideration:\n\nThe keyhash is a 16-byte blob, constructed either as:\n\n* the big-endian serialization of the key fields, with padding zeroed\n  out and any unneeded bytes also set to zero (the order is presumably\n  that in which the fields occur in the serialization of the sample;\n  and there is presumably padding within the keyhash to maintain CDR\n  alignment, but the spec is not perfectly clear on this); or\n\n* the MD5 hash of the serialized form, if the serialized form cannot be\n  guaranteed to be at most 16 bytes long (i.e., a key consisting of just\n  a bounded string of at most 11 characters is always at most 16 bytes;\n  a key consisting of an unbounded string may be longer).\n\nThe idea is that this allows a more efficient way of identifying the\ninstances in the reader, and (as per the DDS Security spec, 7.1.1.4) to\nallow infrastructures services to implement the DDS QoS (notably\nhistory) without knowing the type or being able to decrypt the data.\nProblems are plentiful, with some obvious ones:\n\n* The first and obvious problem for using the keyhash to identify\n  instances is that there can be hash collisions once MD5 gets used;\n\n* The quality of the keyhash if it is not the MD5 hash of the serialized\n  key is abominable as a hash, necessitating further hashing on the\n  reader side and neutering the potential performance advantage;\n\n* The need to serialize the key fields twice;\n\nfor which reasons Cyclone DDS originally tried to avoid generating or\nusing the keyhash.  With the addition of DDS Security and DDS XTypes,\nsome additional issues are introduced:\n\n* The Security spec mandates that the keyhash it is *always* in \"MD5\n  form\" when keys are to be protected. However, it is possible for a\n  reader to match both secured and non-secured writers, and in such a\n  case, for topics where the keyhash ordinarily is *not* MD5, the same\n  instance will be identified by different key hashes for the two\n  writers;\n\n* XTypes' notion of assignability allows different matching writers to\n  have different forms of keyhashes (plain/MD5) and to have differently\n  sized keys that result in a different serialization.  E.g.:\n\n    string<10> is-assignable-to string\n\n  and can cause the plain/MD5 confusion, and\n\n    short is-assignable-to int\n\n  and so a writer for {int;int} and one for {short;short} both yield\n  \"plain\" keyhashes that are different, yet describe the same instance,\n  and if the first writes {0x0101,0} and the latter writes {0x01,0x01}\n  there are different instances mapping to the same keyhash.\n\nWith XTypes, the type information is available, so these cases can be\ndetected.  Matching both protected and unprotected writers can also be\ndetected, and so in those cases the keyhash needs to be ignored.  This\nis not yet implemented.\n\nIn short:\n\n* Generating keyhashes is up to the writer, and this is a Cyclone\n  specific extension.\n\n* Keyhashes cannot safely be used as proxies for key values.  At best\n  one can detect problematic cases and refuse to make the keyhash\n  available even when it is present in the message.\n\nAnd so this feature should not be relied on except in well-controlled\nenvironments.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

      "message": "Implementation of topic discovery\n\nThis commit contains the implementation of DDS topic discovery\nwhich enables the exchange of topic information between endpoints\nusing the built-in topic announcer and detector endpoints as\ndescribed in the DDS Specification.\n\nIn this commit:\n\n- An administration of topic definitions, which consist of an identifier\n  (used as key in sedp samples), type identifier, a reference to the\n  sertype for the topic and the topic QoS. The key of a topic definition\n  is a hash value of its type identifier and QoS (the latter also contains\n  the topic name and type name for the topic). Topic definitions are\n  shared between topic entities and proxy-topics (see below).\n\n- A DDSI topic entity is introduced (kind EK_TOPIC), which has a (counted)\n  reference to a topic_definition. The DDSC topic entity is not directly\n  refering to the DDSI entity: this relation is via its reference to a\n  dds_ktopic, which has on its turn has a hash table with a mapping from\n  type_id to <topic guid, ddsi topic>. As the DDS spec does not provide\n  an entity kinds for DDSI topic entities, vendor specific entity\n  kinds NN_ENTITYID_KIND_CYCLONE_TOPIC_BUILTIN (0x0c) and\n  NN_ENTITYID_KIND_CYCLONE_TOPIC_USER (0x0d) are used. DDSI Topic entities\n  are stored in the global entity index.\n\n- A list of proxy-topics is added to the (DDSI) proxy participant struct,\n  to keep track of the entity_ids and topic definition of topics discovered\n  for this proxy participant.\n\n- A local builtin (orphan) writer is added that writes DCPSTopic samples for\n  discovered (proxy) topics. When a topic is discovered that uses a new\n  topic definition (that was not in the topic definition administration),\n  a sample is written using this writer and the topic definition is stored.\n\n- The implementation of the api functions for finding topics. This function\n  takes a scope parameter (type dds_find_scope_t). The scope can be used to\n  search for a topic that was created in the local participant or domain,\n  or (DDS_FIND_SCOPE_GLOBAL) to search for topics that are discovered using\n  the builtin SEDP endpoint, as well as for locally created topics. This\n  function takes an optional timeout parameter (can be 0 to disable) to\n  allow waiting for the topic to become available (implemented using a\n  condition variable that is triggered when new topic definitions are\n  registered).\n\n- The built-in endpoints for exchanging topic discovery information can\n  be enabled/disabled via a configuration option. The key for a SEDP sample\n  for topic information is the topic definition hash as described above.\n  This key is sent in a vendor specific plist parameter PID_CYCLONE_TOPIC_GUID\n  (vendor specific parameter 0x1b).\n\n- Proxy topic guids are added in the proxy guid list in struct tl_meta records,\n  to keep track of the proxy topics that are refering to the type lookup meta-data.\n  The data structure for this list is replaced by the generic templated list\n  that was added in another previous commit.\n\n- DCPSTopic support is enabled in the ddsls tool.\n\n- New tests and fixes in existing topic and builtin_topic tests to reflect\n  the deprecation of the old find topic api function.\n\n- Adding a build option to control whether topic discovery is included\n  in the build. Default value is 'off'.\n\n- Design documentation for topic and type discovery\n\nSigned-off-by: Dennis Potman <dennis.potman@adlinktech.com>"

In typetree.h the\ntype ddsts_call_path_t has been added. This is not part of the\nTypeTree but needed in utility functions that depend on the path\nthrough which a type is reached. An example of such a function, is\nthe function ddsts_declaration_is_key, that can be used to find out\nif a member declaration of an (embedded) struct is defined as a key.\nThe file type_walk.h with the function ddsts_walk has been added.\n\nThe implementation of the back-end makes use of the type gen_ostream\nas a generic kind of output stream with function pointers for\nopening and closing 'files'. In the tests this is used to capture\nthe generated output into a buffer. It could, for example, also be\nused to place the generated output in a specified target directory.\nThe file gen_c99.h declares two functions for generating the C99\nback-end given the name of the input file and a pointer to a type.\n\nIn the front-end a small problem with freeing has been solved in\ncase of an error. For this the semantics of ddsts_free_type have\nbeen changed, such that it returns an error when a pointer to a part\nof a type is passed. A check for using a forward struct (with no\nstruct definition) in a member declaration has been added.\n\nSigned-off-by: Frans Faase <frans.faase@adlinktech.com>"

      "message": "Serialize updates to concurrent hopscotch hash\n\nThere are intermittent failures on Travis CI where tests seem to\nrandomly timeout and appear to do so at the end of the test.  Sometimes\nthis happens on a machine and in a state where the liveliness monitoring\nwill cough up a stack trace.  In the cases where I have seen such stack\ntraces and they contain more than mere numbers (so at least some symbol\nnames), there was often (perhaps always, I am not sure of that) one\nthread attempting to lock a bucket in the concurrent hash table and\nbeing blocked in a ddsrt_cond_wait.  One can only conclude that there\nmay be a problem in that implementation.\n\nThis commit eliminates the concurrent updates while leaving the lookups\nlock-free.  The locking scheme becomes a simple mutex around the\nadd/remove operations.  With this change I have not seen any sign of\nthese particular timeouts in a fairly large number of CI runs.  I\nconfess to not yet having been able to reproduce it on either macOS or\nLinux, x64 or ARM, and to not yet knowing the root cause, but I think\nthat the circumstantial evidence by now is enough to make this change.\n\nIt so happens that this change is unlikely to be bad for performance.\nThe argument is twofold: (1) contention on updates is not actually an\nissue given how the hash tables are used; and (2) the simpler locking\nscheme allows for more efficient use of memory and should on average\nyield a small reduction in cache misses on lookups.\n\nRe (1): there are two uses of the concurrent hash table in Cyclone: the\nGUID index (ephash) and the key-to-instance-id map (tkmap).  The former\nis changed only when entities are created or deleted, which is a fairly\nexpensive operation and executed relatively rarely.  Contention on this\nhash table for updates is not really not an issue.\n\nFor the key-to-instance-id map, in DDS instances/key values are\nrelatively heavy-weight because of the registrations and the need to\nunregister after writing.  Consequently, the vast majority of the data\nflowing through the system reuses existing key values.  The\nimplementation is such that it only tries to update the hash table after\na lookup has failed.  Again leading to the conclusion that contention\non updates should not be a significant issue.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

This first implementation is not compliant with\nthe DDS XTypes specification in the sense that it currently uses a different\ntype_information format (md5 hash of the serialized sertype), and the exchanged\ntypes are not a TypeObject, but a serialized ddsi_sertype object.\nAt a later stage, when the XTypes type system is implemented, we can plug that\ninto this implementation and get a more spec compliant implementation of the\ntype discovery.\n\nThis commit includes a partial implementation of type consistency enforcement\nqos policy and a (limited) assignability check for sertype_default that is used\nwhen matching readers and writers.\n\nA build option ENABLE_TYPE_DISCOVERY is added so that type discovery support\ncan be disabled when building Cyclone.

      "message": "OpenSSL 1.0.2 compatibility\n\nThis addresses a number of issues with building Cyclone DDS including\nDDS Security while using OpenSSL 1.0.2. Compatibility with 1.0.2 is a\ncourtesy towards those who are unable to move to 1.1.x or later because\nof other libraries.\n\n* On Windows, one must include Winsock2.h prior to including the OpenSSL\n  header files, or it'll pull in incompatible definitions from Winsock.h\n  and that breaks some of the files.\n\n* OpenSSL 1.0.2 requires initializing the library (or more particular,\n  loading all the required algorithms) but this is no longer needed in\n  OpenSSL 1.1.x. It ends up being needed in a few places and having tons\n  of essentially dead initialization code lying around is unpleasant.\n  Hence this has been consolidated in a single function and protected\n  with ddsrt_once().\n\n* One ought to undo the above initialization on 1.0.2g and older, but it\n  is impossible to know whether that can safely be done from a library.\n  This is also the reason OpenSSL deprecated all the initialization and\n  cleanup interfaces. So if one insists on trying it with such an old\n  version, let there be some leaks.\n\n* Thread state cleanup is sort-of required prior 1.1.0, but that suffers\n  from the same problems; we'd have to do per-thread cleanup code for\n  OpenSSL for any thread that could call into it (which is pretty much\n  any thread). So once again, people should just use 1.1.0 or newer.\n\n* There are some interfaces added in 1.1.0 that we use, but a few small\n  workarounds those can be made to work on 1.0.2 as well. These also\n  were replicated in a number of places and consolidated by this commit.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

For example (before this change):\n\n1. initial situation: three writers w1, w2 and w3 with equal lease\n   durations:\n   - pp.heap = w1.lease : w2.lease w3.lease\n   - pp.minl = clone of w1.lease\n\n2. delete w2:\n   - assuming deleting w2.lease from the heap moves w3.lease to the\n     front (only guarantee is that there are no smaller keys in the heap\n     than that of the entry returned by minimum operation)\n   - min(pp.heap) = w1.lease != w2.lease\n     thus: pp.minl unchanged, pp.minl.entity = w1\n   - pp.heap = w3.lease : w1.lease\n\n3. delete w1:\n   - min(pp.heap) = w3.lease != w1.lease,\n     thus: pp.minl unchanged, pp.minl.entity = w1\n   - pp.heap = w3\n   - free w1\n   - now pp.minl.entity has a dangling pointer, touched on deleting\n     the (proxy) particpant or on lease expiry.\n\nWith this chamge, pp.minl is updated in step 2 to be a clone of w3.lease\nbecause the lease returned by min(pp.heap) changes.  This ensures that\nin step 3 there is no dangling pointer and no use-after-free.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

(Note: there may be other factors at play, but this is\nwhat it looks like after experimentation.)\n\nAt least Fast-RTPS in some versions binds the socket it uses for\ntransmitting multicasts to non-0.0.0.0, so interoperability with\nFast-RTPS on Windows requires us to bind the socket we use for\ntransmitting multicasts (which was the same as the one we use for\nreceiving unicast data) also to non-0.0.0.0 or our multicasts get\ndropped often.\n\nThis would work fine if other implementations honoured the set of\nadvertised addresses.

      "message": "Avoid race causing thread-state pointer aliasing\n\nThe thread_states array resets the \"state\" to ZERO on thread termination\nto indicate that the slot was unused, but it leaves the thread id\nunchanged because some platforms don't have a defined value that will\nnever be used as a thread id.  A consequence is that a newly created\nthread may result in multiple slots containing their own thread id, but\ngenerally there will only be one that is not in state ZERO.\n\nHowever, the code for create_thread used to set the state to ALIVE prior\nto creating the thread, and so if the events get scheduled like:\n\n1. thread A: X.state = ALIVE\n2. create new thread B, storing tid in X.tid\n3. thread A: Y.state = ALIVE\n4. new thread B: lookup self (and cache pointer)\n5. create new thread C, storing tid in Y.tid\n6. new thread C: lookup self (and cache pointer)\n\nThen B will observe two slots in the ALIVE state, with X.tid certain to\nmatch and Y.tid undefined (and hence possibly matching).  It may\ntherefore pick Y.  C will (in this schedule) of course always choose Y.\nThey cache the pointer and never look at X and Y again, except for\nupdating their virtual clocks.\n\nThese virtual clocks are updated non-atomically (by design it is private\nto the thread) and so if both B & C use Y they can end up racing each\nother in updating the virtual clock and cause the nesting level of the\n\"awake\" state controlling garbage collection to get stuck (or wrap\naround, or do other horrible things).  The consequence can be anything,\nfrom a somewhat benign variant where GC effectively stops and some\noperations (deleting readers and writers and shutting down) block\nforever, to use-after-free and the undefined behaviour that implies.\n\nThis commit avoids looking up the slot in the newly created threads,\ninstead passing the correct address in the argument.  It also adds an\nintermediate state INIT that serves to reserve the slot until the new\nthread is actually running.  It does make the look-up safe (if one were\nto do it), and as it is essentially free and gives more insight in the\nstate of the system when viewed from a debugger, it appears a useful\naddition.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

The description of this QoS in\nthe DDS specification (section 2.2.3.7):\n\n\"This policy is useful for cases where a Topic is expected to\nhave each instance updated periodically. On the publishing side this\nsetting establishes a contract that the application must meet.\nOn the subscribing side the setting establishes a minimum\nrequirement for the remote publishers that are expected to supply\nthe data values.\"\n\nOn the writer side, the deadline missed event also needs to trigger in\ncase only local readers exist. The implementation for this inserts\nthe sample in the writer history cache temporary, so that an instance\nis created in the whc. Immediately after inserting the sample, it is\nremoved again. With the creation of the instance, the deadline missed event\nis created, which will take care of triggering the deadline missed\ncallback if required. In case the instance already existed, the timer\nof the event is renewed.\n\nTo verify the changes to the writer history cache, add an additional\ntest to check the write history cache state. This test checks the state\nof the whc after writing samples by a writer with specific combinations\nof qos settings. The state of the whc is checked for stored\nsamples (min/max sequence number) and the absence of unacked data, after\nwriting samples and wait for acks by the local and/or remote\nreaders (which is also a parameter for this test). This test is\nintroduced as part of the deadline implementation, but its scope is\nwider than only the changes that were made in the whc implementation for\nthe deadline qos.\n\nThis test showed that even before the deadline support was added,\nwhc_default_remove_acked_messages_full data was not marked as acked in\ncase of transient-local keep-all. This resulted in data in whc that\nnever gets in acked state. This has been fixed as well.\n\nSigned-off-by: Dennis Potman <dennis.potman@adlinktech.com>"

In addition I've optimized the locking in\nunref_proxy_participant a bit and fixed the liveliness changed callback\nwhen a writer with expired lease (not-alive) gets alive again.\n\nSigned-off-by: Dennis Potman <dennis.potman@adlinktech.com>"

      "message": "Liveliness QoS implementation for auto and manual-by-participant\n\nThis commit adds support for the liveliness QoS for the liveliness\nkinds automatic and manual-by-participant. It also implements the\nlease_duration from this QoS, which was ignored until now. In the\napi the function dds_assert_liveliness is added to assert liveliness\non a participant, which can be used when using liveliness kind\nmanual-by-participant.\n\nLiveliness kind manual-by-topic is not yet supported, this will be\nadded in a later commit.\n\n* Proxy participants now have 2 fibheaps to keep leases: one for leases\nof pwrs with automatic liveliness and one for leases of the pwrs with\nmanual-by-participant liveliness (both protected by the proxypp lock).\nThe minl_auto and minl_man members represent the shortest lease from\nthese fibheaps and these leases are renewed when receiving data.\nReplacing the minl_ leases is now done by replacing the lease object\n(atomic ptr) with delayed deletion of the old lease using the gc.\n\n* Proxy writers are set not-alive when the lease expired, and reset to\nalive then data is received. When data is received by a pwr, the other\npwrs in the proxypp might also be set alive. I think the specification\nis not clear at this point, and for now I have not implemented this\n\n* I refactored out the counter for man-by-pp proxy writers and improved\nlocking when updating the min-leases on the proxy participant, so I\nthink this fixes the race conditions.\n\nSome additional tests are required, e.g. to test the not-alive->alive\ntransition for pwrs. I will add these in short term, as well as the\nimplementation of the manual-by-topic liveliness kind.\n\nSigned-off-by: Dennis Potman <dennis.potman@adlinktech.com>"

      "message": "Builtin authentication plugin for DDS Security\nBuiltin authentication plugin of DDS Security implementation was added.\nThis plugin is the first implementation and it also contains the functions that are used initially in the secure communication sequence.\n\nThe builtin authentication plugin implements authentication using a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). It performs mutual authentication between discovered participants using the RSA or ECDSA Digital Signature Algorithms and establishes a shared secret using Diffie-Hellman (DH) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) Key Agreement Methods.\n\nDDS Security core component is introduced with this commit. DDSI and other builtin plugins will also use the security core.\n\nLike all builtin plugins, dds security authentication plugin is a shared library for providing dynamic library loading on runtime. So that, dds participants can use different plugin implementations with different configurations.\n\nAuthentication plugin uses ddsrt functions. ddsrt is not expected to be a shared library and statically adding ddsrt objects to authentication library produces linkage errors in windows. So, dynamically linking authentication plugin to ddc library is decided. Another decision should be taken for the platforms that are not supporting dynamic libraries later.\n\nSigned-off-by: Kurtulus Oksuztepe <kurtulus.oksuztepe@adlinktech.com>"

This\ncommit fixes (most?) of them, with exception of some nastiness when\ndeleting the last entity, and thus deinitialising the library, in\nparallel to attempting to operate on a (by definition invalid) handle.\n\n* Interrupting a blocked operation at the beginning of \"delete\" is now a\n  separate operation.  E.g., a wait call on a waitset must be interrupted,\n  but the data structures can't be touched yet because other threads may\n  be doing an attach/detach in parallel.\n\n* DDSI writer can now be switched to an intermediate state,\n  \"INTERRUPTED\", to indicate that it should unblock any waiting threads\n  and refuse to transmit any further data, but without actually\n  embarking on the path of deleting data structures.\n\n* The extra \"pinning\" of readers and writers is now gone, they remain\n  fully functional until the no other threads can still access the\n  entity.\n\n* Future listener invocations are prevented as part of deleting the\n  entity, but now it also guarantees the application can no longer\n  re-enable them.  It furthermore waits until there are no further\n  current or pending listener invocations, rather than simply no current\n  ones.\n\n* The internal state of the waitset now has its own lock, otherwise\n  attaching the parent entity of the waitset can require locking the\n  waitset after having locking the parent, which violates locking order.\n\n* Handles are created in a pending state, where they are not included in\n  a dds_get_children operation and refuse to be pinned.  This makes it\n  possible (in a future commit) to undo deletion of complex entities.\n\n* There is a test (ddsc_waitset_torture) that exercises some of these\n  corner cases.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

The handle of the latter is a\ncompile-constant, DDS_CYCLONEDDS_HANDLE.\n\nThis changes the return value from dds_get_parent when executed on a\nparticipant: it now returns the handle of the entity representing the\ndomain the participant is attached to.  Two participants in the same\ndomain self-evidently return the same domain entity.\n\nThis allows deleting all participants in a domain by calling dds_delete\non the domain entity, or tearing down everything and deinitializing the\nlibrary by calling dds_delete on the top-level entity.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

In most\ncases, the order was first locking entity X, then locking the parent\nentity of X.  However, in some cases the order was reversed, a likely\ncause of deadlocks.\n\nThis commit sorts these problems, and in particular propagating\noperations into children.  The entity refcount is now part of the handle\nadministration so that it is no longer necessary to lock an entity to\ndetermine whether it is still allowed to be used (previously it had to\ncheck the CLOSED flag afterward).  This allows recursing into the\nchildren while holding handles and the underlying objects alive, but\nwithout violating lock order.\n\nAttendant changes that would warrant there own commits but are too hard\nto split off:\n\n* Children are now no longer in a singly linked list, but in an AVL\n  tree; this was necessary at some intermediate stage to allow unlocking\n  an entity and restarting iteration over all children at the \"next\"\n  child (all thanks to the eternally unique instance handle);\n\n* Waitsets shifted to using arrays of attached entities instead of\n  linked lists; this was a consequence of dealing with some locking\n  issues in reading triggers and considering which operations on the\n  \"triggered\" and \"observed\" sets are actually needed.\n\n* Entity status flags and waitset/condition trigger counts are now\n  handled using atomic operations.  Entities are now classified as\n  having a \"status\" with a corresponding mask, or as having a \"trigger\n  count\" (conditions).  As there are fewer than 16 status bits, the\n  status and its mask can squeeze into the same 32-bits as the trigger\n  count.  These atomic updates avoid the need for a separate lock just\n  for the trigger/status values and results in a significant speedup\n  with waitsets.\n\n* Create topic now has a more rational behaviour when multiple\n  participants attempt to create the same topic: each participant now\n  gets its own topic definition, but the underlying type representation\n  is shared.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

The crazy ones (IPv4 address and port\nrely on additional state and are completely special-cased).\n\nGiven these tables, the serialization, finalisation, validation,\nmerging, unalias'ing can all be handled by a very small amount of custom\ncode and an appropriately defined generic function for the common cases.\nThis also makes it possible to have all QoS validation in place, and so\nremoves the need for the specialized implementations for the various\nentity kinds in the upper layer.\n\nQoS inapplicable to an entity were previously ignored, allowing one to\nhave invalid values set in a QoS object when creating an entity,\nprovided that the invalid values are irrelevant to that entity.  Whether\nthis is a good thing or not is debatable, but certainly it is a good\nthing to avoid copying in inapplicable QoS settings.

      "message": "ensure delivery of writes immediately following pub match event (#165)\n\nA long-standing bug of Cyclone is that a sample written immediately\nafter a publication-matched event may never arrive at the reader that\nwas just matched.  This happened because the reader need not have\ncompleted discovery of the writer by the time the writer discovers the\nreader, at which point the reader ignores the sample because it either\ndoesn't know the writer at all, or it hasn't yet seen a Heartbeat from\nit.\n\nThat Heartbeat arrives shortly after, but by then it is too late: the\nreader slaves decides to accept the next sample to be written by the\nwriter.  (It has no choice, really: either you risk losing some data, or\nyou will be requesting all historical data, which is empathically not\nwhat a volatile reader is about ...)\n\nA related issue is the handling of historical data for transient-local\nreaders: it used to deliver this out-of-order, but that is firstly\nagainst the specification, and secondly, against reasonable expectations\nof those who use DDS as a mere publish-subscribe messaging system.  To\nadd insult to injury, it didn't completely handle some reordering issues\nwith disposes ...\n\nThis commit changes the way writers respond to a request for\nretransmission from volatile proxy readers and the way the\nin-sync/out-of-sync setting of a reader with respect to a proxy-writer\nis used.  The first makes it safe for a Cyclone reader to ask a Cyclone\nwriter for all data (all these details not being covered in the specs it\nerrs on the reasonable side for other vendors, but that may cause the\ndata loss mentioned above): the writer simply send a Gap message to the\nreader for all the sequence numbers prior to the matching.\n\nThe second changes the rule for switching from out-of-sync to in-sync:\nthat transition is now simply once the next sequence number to be\ndelivered to the reader equals the next sequence number that will be\ndelivered directly from the proxy writer object to all readers.  (I.e.,\na much more intuitive notion than reaching some seemingly arbitrary\nsequence number.)\n\nTo avoid duplicates the rule for delivery straight from a proxy writer\nhas changed: where samples were delivered from the proxy writer to all\nmatching readers, they are now delivered only to the matching readers\nthat are in-sync.  To avoid ordering problems, the idea that historical\ndata can be delivered through the asynchronous delivery path even when\nthe regular data goes through the synchronous delivery path has been\nabandoned.  All data now always follows the same path.\n\nAs these same mechanisms are used for getting historical data into\ntransient-local readers, the ordering problem for the historical data\nalso disappeared.\n\nThe test stuff in src/core/xtests/initsampledeliv covers a lot of the\ninteresting cases: data published before the existene of a reader, after\nit, mixes of volatile and transient-local.  Running them takes quite a\nbit of time, and they are not yet integrated in the CI builds (if ever,\nbecause of that time).\n\nNote: the \"conservative built-in startup\" option has been removed,\nbecause it really makes no sense to keep a vague compatibility option\nadded a decade ago \"just in case\" that has never been used ...\n\nNote: the workaround in the src/mpt/tests/basic/procs/hello.c (use\ntransient-local to ensure delivery of data) has been removed, as has\nbeen its workaround for the already-fixed #146.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

This\ncommit adds some information on the instruction format obtained by\nreverse engineering the code and studying the output of the IDL\npreprocessor, and furthermore changes a lot of the types used in the\n(de)serializer code to have some more compiler support.  The IDL\npreprocessor is untouched and the generated instructinos do exactly the\nsame thing (except where change was needed).\n\nThe bulk of this commit replaces the implementation of the\n(de)serializer.  It is still rather ugly, but at least the very long\nfunctions with several levels of nested conditions and switch statements\nhave been split out into multiple functions.  Most of these have single\ncall-sites, so the compiler hopefully inlines them nicely.\n\nThe other important thing is that it adds a \"normalize\" function that\nvalidates the structure of the CDR and performs byteswapping if\nnecessary.  This means the deserializer can now assume a well-formed\ninput in native byte-order.  Checks and conditional byteswaps have been\nremoved accordingly.\n\nIt changes some types to make a compile-time distinction between\nread-only, native-endianness input, a native-endianness output, and a\nbig-endian output for dealing with key hashes.  This should reduce the\nrisk of accidentally mixing endianness or modifying an input stream.\n\nThe preprocessor has been modified to indicate the presence of unions in\na topic type in the descriptor flags.  If a union is present, any\nmemory allocated in a sample is freed first and the sample is zero'd out\nprior to deserializing the new value.  This is to prevent reading\ngarbage pointers for strings and sequences when switching union cases.\n\nThe test tool has been included in the commit but it does not get run by\nitself.  Firstly, it requires the presence of OpenSplice DDS as an\nalternative implementation to check the CDR processing against.\nSecondly, it takes quite a while to run and is of no interest unless one\nchanges something in the (de)serialization.\n\nFinally, I have no idea why there was a \"CDR stream\" interface among the\npublic functions.  The existing interfaces are fundamentally broken by\nthe removal of arbitrary-endianness streams, and the interfaces were\nalready incapable of proper error notification.  So, they have been\nremoved.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

Their removal is therefore not expected\nto break backwards compatibility (which would be anyway be limited to\nCyclone complaining about undefined settings at startup):\n\n* Tracing/Timestamps[@absolute]: has always been ignored\n\n* Tracing/Timestamps: has always been ignored\n\n* General/EnableLoopback: ignored for quite some time, before that\n  changing it from the default resulted in crashes.\n\n* General/StartupModeDuration: it did what it advertised (retain data in\n  the history caches of volatile writers as-if they were transient-local\n  with a durability history setting of keep-last 1 for the first few\n  seconds after startup of the DDSI stack) but had no purpose other than\n  complicating things as the volatile readers ignored the data anyway.\n\n* General/StartupModeCoversTransient: see previous -- and besides,\n  transient data is not supported yet in Cyclone.\n\n* Compatibility/RespondToRtiInitZeroAckWithInvalidHeartbeat: arguably a\n  good setting given that DDSI < 2.3 explicitly requires that all\n  HEARTBEAT messages sent by a writer advertise the existence of at least\n  1 sample, but this has been fixed in DDSI 2.3.  As this requirement was\n  never respected by most DDSI implementations, there is no point in\n  retaining the setting, while it does remove a rather tricky problem\n  immediately after writer startup involving the conjuring up of a\n  sample that was annihilated immediately before it could have been\n  observed.\n\n  That conjuring up (as it turns out) can cause a malformed message to go\n  out (one that is harmless in itself).  Fixing the generation of that\n  malformed message while the entire point of the trick is moot in DDSI\n  2.3 is a bit silly.\n\n  Note that full DDSI 2.3 compliance needs a bit more work, so not\n  bumping the DDSI protocol version number yet.\n\n* Compatibility/AckNackNumbitsEmptySet: changing it from 0 breaks\n  compatibility with (at least) RTI Connext, and its reason for\n  existence disappers with a fix in DDSI 2.3.\n\n* Internal/AggressiveKeepLastWhc: changing the setting from the default\n  made no sense whatsoever in Cyclone -- it would only add flow-control\n  and potentially block a keep-last writer where the spec forbids that.\n\n* Internal/LegacyFragmentation: a left-over from almost a decade ago when\n  it was discovered that the specification was inconsistent in the use\n  of the message header flags for fragmented data, and this stack for a\n  while used the non-common interpretation.  There is no reasonable way of\n  making the two modes compatible, and this setting merely existed to\n  deal with the compatibility issue with some ancient OpenSplice DDS\n  version.\n\n* Durability/Encoding: historical junk.\n\n* WatchDog and Lease: never had any function in Cyclone.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

A bunch of dedicated parallel allocators help take some\npressure off the regular malloc/free calls.  However, these used to\ngobble up memory like crazy, in part because of rather generous limits,\nand in part because there was no restriction on the size of the samples\nthat would be cached, and it could end up caching large numbers of\nmulti-MB samples.  It should be noted that there is no benefit to\ncaching large samples anyway, because the sample rate will be that much\nlower.\n\nThis commit reduces the maximum number of entries for all three cases,\nit furthermore limits the maximum size of a serdata or xmsg that can be\ncached, and finally instead of instantiating a separate allocator for\nWHC nodes per WHC, it now shares one across all WHCs.  Total memory use\nshould now be limited to a couple of MB.\n\nThe caching can be disabled by setting ``FREELIST_TYPE`` to\n``FREELIST_NONE`` in ``q_freelist.h``.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

      "message": "initial version of permance/network check tool\n\nThe current situation for performance measurements and checking network\nbehaviour is rather unsatisfactory, as the only tools available are\n``pubsub`` and the ``roundtrip`` and ``throughput`` examples.  The first\ncan do many things thanks to its thousand-and-one options, but its\npurpose really is to be able to read/write arbitrary data with arbitrary\nQoS -- though the arbitrary data bit was lost in the hacked conversion\nfrom the original code.  The latter two have a terrible user interface,\ndon't perform any verification that the measurement was successful and\ndo not provide the results in a convenient form.\n\nFurthermore, the abuse of the two examples as the primary means for\nmeasuring performance has resulted in a reduction of their value as an\nexample, e.g., they can do waitset- or listener-based reading (and the\nthroughput one also polling-based), but that kind of complication does\nnot help a new user understand what is going on.  Especially not given\nthat these features were simply hacked in.\n\nHence the need for a new tool, one that integrates the common\nmeasurements and can be used to verify that the results make sense.  It\nis not quite done yet, in particular it is lacking in a number of\naspects:\n\n* no measurement of CPU- and network load, memory usage and context\n  switches yet;\n* very limited statistics (min/max/average, if you're lucky; no\n  interesting things such as jitter on a throughput test yet);\n* it can't yet gather the data from all participants in the network\n  using DDS;\n* it doesn't output the data in a convenient file format yet;\n* it doesn't allow specifying boundaries within which the results\n  must fall for the run to be successful.\n\nWhat it does verify is that all the endpoint matches that should exist\ngiven the discovered participant do in fact come into existence,\nreporting an error (and exiting with an exit status code of 1) if they\ndon't, as well as checking the number of participants.  With the way the\nDDSI protocol works, this is a pretty decent network connectivity check.\n\nThe raw measurements needed for the desired statistics (apart from\nsystem-level measurements) are pretty much made, so the main thing that\nstill needs to be done is exploit them and output them.

      "message": "lift limits on handle allocation and reuse (#95)\n\nThe old entity handle mechanism suffered from a number of problems, the\nmost terrible one being that it would only ever allocate 1000 handles\n(not even have at most 1000 in use at the same time).  Secondarily, it\nwas protected by a single mutex that actually does show up as a limiting\nfactor in, say, a polling-based throughput test with small messages.\nThirdly, it tried to provide for various use cases that don't exist in\npractice but add complexity and overhead.\n\nThis commit totally rewrites the mechanism, by replacing the old array\nwith a hash table and allowing a near-arbitrary number of handles as\nwell as reuse of handles.  It also removes the entity \"kind\" bits in the\nmost significant bits of the handles, because they only resulted in\nincorrect checking of argument validity.  All that is taken out, but\nthere is still more cleaning up to be done.  It furthermore removes an\nindirection in the handle-to-entity lookup by embedding the\n\"dds_handle_link\" structure in the entity.\n\nHandle allocation is randomized to avoid the have a high probability of\nquickly finding an available handle (the total number of handles is\nlimited to a number much smaller than the domain from which they are\nallocated).  The likelihood of handle reuse is still dependent on the\nnumber of allocated handles -- the fewer handles there are, the longer\nthe expected time to reuse.  Non-randomized handles would give a few\nguarantees more, though.\n\nIt moreover moves the code from the \"util\" to the \"core/ddsc\" component,\nbecause it really is only used for entities, and besides the new\nimplementation relies on the deferred freeing (a.k.a. garbage collection\nmechanism) implemented in the core.\n\nThe actual handle management has two variants, selectable with a macro:\nthe preferred embodiment uses a concurrent hash table, the actually used\none performs all operations inside a single mutex and uses a\nnon-concurrent version of the hash table.  The reason the\nless-predeferred embodiment is used is that the concurrent version\nrequires the freeing of entity objects to be deferred (much like the\nGUID-to-entity hash tables in DDSI function, or indeed the key value to\ninstance handle mapping).  That is a fair bit of work, and the\nnon-concurrent version is a reasonable intermediate step.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

As this requirement was\n  never respected by most DDSI implementations, there is no point in\n  retaining the setting, while it does remove a rather tricky problem\n  immediately after writer startup involving the conjuring up of a\n  sample that was annihilated immediately before it could have been\n  observed.\n\n  That conjuring up (as it turns out) can cause a malformed message to go\n  out (one that is harmless in itself).

The first\ncan do many things thanks to its thousand-and-one options, but its\npurpose really is to be able to read/write arbitrary data with arbitrary\nQoS -- though the arbitrary data bit was lost in the hacked conversion\nfrom the original code.  The latter two have a terrible user interface,\ndon't perform any verification that the measurement was successful and\ndo not provide the results in a convenient form.\n\nFurthermore, the abuse of the two examples as the primary means for\nmeasuring performance has resulted in a reduction of their value as an\nexample, e.g., they can do waitset- or listener-based reading (and the\nthroughput one also polling-based), but that kind of complication does\nnot help a new user understand what is going on.  Especially not given\nthat these features were simply hacked in.\n\nHence the need for a new tool, one that integrates the common\nmeasurements and can be used to verify that the results make sense.  It\nis not quite done yet, in particular it is lacking in a number of\naspects:\n\n* no measurement of CPU- and network load, memory usage and context\n  switches yet;\n* very limited statistics (min/max/average, if you're lucky; no\n  interesting things such as jitter on a throughput test yet);\n* it can't yet gather the data from all participants in the network\n  using DDS;\n* it doesn't output the data in a convenient file format yet;\n* it doesn't allow specifying boundaries within which the results\n  must fall for the run to be successful.\n\nWhat it does verify is that all the endpoint matches that should exist\ngiven the discovered participant do in fact come into existence,\nreporting an error (and exiting with an exit status code of 1) if they\ndon't, as well as checking the number of participants.  With the way the\nDDSI protocol works, this is a pretty decent network connectivity check.\n\nThe raw measurements needed for the desired statistics (apart from\nsystem-level measurements) are pretty much made, so the main thing that\nstill needs to be done is exploit them and output them.

      "message": "lift limits on handle allocation and reuse (#95)\n\nThe old entity handle mechanism suffered from a number of problems, the\nmost terrible one being that it would only ever allocate 1000 handles\n(not even have at most 1000 in use at the same time).  Secondarily, it\nwas protected by a single mutex that actually does show up as a limiting\nfactor in, say, a polling-based throughput test with small messages.\nThirdly, it tried to provide for various use cases that don't exist in\npractice but add complexity and overhead.\n\nThis commit totally rewrites the mechanism, by replacing the old array\nwith a hash table and allowing a near-arbitrary number of handles as\nwell as reuse of handles.  It also removes the entity \"kind\" bits in the\nmost significant bits of the handles, because they only resulted in\nincorrect checking of argument validity.  All that is taken out, but\nthere is still more cleaning up to be done.  It furthermore removes an\nindirection in the handle-to-entity lookup by embedding the\n\"dds_handle_link\" structure in the entity.\n\nHandle allocation is randomized to avoid the have a high probability of\nquickly finding an available handle (the total number of handles is\nlimited to a number much smaller than the domain from which they are\nallocated).  The likelihood of handle reuse is still dependent on the\nnumber of allocated handles -- the fewer handles there are, the longer\nthe expected time to reuse.  Non-randomized handles would give a few\nguarantees more, though.\n\nIt moreover moves the code from the \"util\" to the \"core/ddsc\" component,\nbecause it really is only used for entities, and besides the new\nimplementation relies on the deferred freeing (a.k.a. garbage collection\nmechanism) implemented in the core.\n\nThe actual handle management has two variants, selectable with a macro:\nthe preferred embodiment uses a concurrent hash table, the actually used\none performs all operations inside a single mutex and uses a\nnon-concurrent version of the hash table.  The reason the\nless-predeferred embodiment is used is that the concurrent version\nrequires the freeing of entity objects to be deferred (much like the\nGUID-to-entity hash tables in DDSI function, or indeed the key value to\ninstance handle mapping).  That is a fair bit of work, and the\nnon-concurrent version is a reasonable intermediate step.\n\nSigned-off-by: Erik Boasson <eb@ilities.com>"

The\nresult is that the process will run in isolation, which is typically not\nthe desired result. (It is a quite annoying problem because it happens\non Linux when only a loopback interface is available. It appears that\nmulticast over loopback works fine, if only you try it, but the kernel\ndoesn't advertise it and so it doesn't get used.)\n\nThis commit changes two things: firstly, it this case it forces the\nallocation of \"well-known\" unicast ports, and secondly, it automatically\nadds the local interface's address to the discovery address set.

For this, rtps_term had to be split, so now it is \"stop\"\nfollowed by \"fini\".\n\nAdd a notion of local writers that are not bound to a participant (\"local\norphans\"), so that the local built-in topic writers can be created during\ninitialization.  This eliminates the \"builtin\" participant.  This\nuncovered in inconsistency in the unit tests: on the one hand, a newly\ncreated participant is expected to have no child entities; on the other\nhand, the built-in topics were expected to be returned by find_topic ...\nThis inconsistency has been resolved by creating them lazily and\naccepting that find_topic can't return them until they have been\ncreated.  Special code was in place in dds_create_reader anyway, so it\nis not expected to have any real consequence for applications.\n\nUse a special WHC implementation that regenerates the data on the fly\nusing the internal discovery tables of DDSI, so that the samples are only\nstored by readers.
