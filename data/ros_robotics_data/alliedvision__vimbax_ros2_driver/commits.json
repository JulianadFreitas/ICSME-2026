      "message": "Fixed adjust packet size is not called automatically for GigE cameras\n\nWith the has_feature method it is now possible to check if a feature is present in a specific GenTL module. This extensions is necessary, because the auto adjust packet size feature is a stream not remote device feature and previously has_feature was only working for remote device features. In case of the auto adjust packet size it always returned false and therefore the packet size was never adjusted correctly. To support this functionality the camera class stores now the feature information for each GenTL module in a map."

      "message": "VmbC API loader now automatically calls VmbStartup / VmbShutdown and reworked unit tests\n\nThe VmbCAPI class now automatically call VmbStartup, when it is loaded, and VmbShutdown, when it is destroyed. VmbCAPI behaves now like a singleton. When get_instance is called the first time the API is loaded and an instance of VmbCAPI is created. All later calls to get_instance will return the same instance independent of the argument libraryLoader. If all instance of VmbCAPI are destroyed, a call get_instance will create a new instance. The VmbCAPI class now also provides all functions of VmbC.\nThe unit test structure is now reworked and simplified. Also, a complete mock for the VmbC API is added, which can be later used for testing."
