This change allows to accumulate the histogram of a submap in local SLAM by adding up the histogram of each new scan.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage is that the background thread doesn't have to loop over all `TrajectoryNode`s of a finished submap to compute the submap histogram for the `RotationalScanMatcher`. Instead this chunk of work is moved to the local SLAM thread but is split up into a few computations for each new scan. When running localization, the histogram of a submap can just be read from a map pbstream and does not have to be computed from the nodes.\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n- This change improved the CPU time of offline SLAM by ~7%.\r\n- Increases the readability of the code and performance of the background thread. (see `PoseGraph3D::ComputeConstraint`)\r\n- No negative performance impacts on accuracy or finding loop-closures\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n- With this change to the submap proto, old maps (pbstreams) are no longer supported and need to be re-created by running offline slam"

      "message": "Add metrics: real time ratio and cpu time ratio. (#1275)\n\nThis PR introduces two metrics to measure performance of local slam: real time ratio, and cpu real time ratio. The latter is introduced to measure the headroom. \r\n\r\nReal time ratio tells us how fast local slam processes the incoming sensor data. When SLAM is falling behind, this is below 100%. In the steady state it is 100% (The real time ratio is above 100% only when slam is 'catching up'.). So this does not tell us how much faster than real time slam processes the data. For this purpose the cpu real time ratio is introduced. It measures how much cpu time slam used, compared to the real time passed to collect the sensor data. Thus it can be more than 100% if slam is faster than real time. For example, a cpu real time ratio of 200% means that slam could process the data twice as fast as it comes in. \r\n\r\nThree durations are measured:\r\n- sensor_duration: the physical time it took to collect the sensor data. \r\n- wall_time_duration: the time it took to process that data\r\n- thread_cpu_duration: CPU time it took to process that data. \r\n\r\nAnd the metrics then are: \r\nreal time ratio = sensor_duration / wall_time_duration\r\ncpu real time ratio = sensor_duration / thread_cpu_duration"

The accumulation duration was measured from accumulation_start to accumulation_stop. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes this to measure the entire time elapsed between two accumulations (i.e. from accumulation_stop to the next accumulation_stop). \r\n\r\nMostly the two measurements result in roughly the same, with the new way measuring slightly larger durations, as expected. But occasionally the measurements differ significantly. This is probably due to a lock contention somewhere outside of what was measured previously. Since we are interested in real time metrics, we need to track the entire time passed."

This refactoring makes libcartographer friendlier for use cases such as that one.\r\n\r\nAn important detail is that I have changed the condition in `WaitForAllComputations` to also check if the work queue is empty. If there are other things on the worker queue besides `ComputeConstraintsForNode`, currently we will wrongfully conclude that all computations are done.
