Updated the smoke tests to run the TUI applications and their demo modes. Updated the hz.launch.py test to measure topics we publish in the background so it doesn't error."

      "message": "Add pre-commit for better linting (#25)\n\nAdds a pre-commit config that uses uncrustify and flake8 just like ament. ament isn't used directly since I wanted formatting to occur outside of a ROS environment when making small fixes. Also has other tools like whitespace, newline, copyright, yaml checks, code spelling, shell script formatting, and commit sign off checking.\n\nUseful for fixing most issues with linting before it is pushed. Automatically reformats your commits, fixes copyright year issues, etc."
