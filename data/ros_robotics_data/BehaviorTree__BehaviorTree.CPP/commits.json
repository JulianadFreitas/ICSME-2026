Users register inheritance\nrelationships at runtime via BehaviorTreeFactory::registerPolymorphicCast,\nand the system handles upcasting/downcasting transparently.\n\nKey components:\n- PolymorphicCastRegistry: thread-safe registry for inheritance\n  relationships with transitive cast support (e.g. Sphynx->Cat->Animal)\n- BehaviorTreeFactory owns the registry, shares it with Blackboards\n- Blackboard::tryCastWithPolymorphicFallback: public Expected-returning\n  API used by both Blackboard::get and TreeNode::getInputStamped\n- XML parser validates port compatibility including polymorphic types\n- Downcasts allowed at parse-time, checked at runtime via\n  dynamic_pointer_cast\n\nDesign decisions:\n- Registry uses shared_mutex for read-heavy workload\n- Error propagation via nonstd::expected<T, std::string>\n- No circular includes: safe_any.hpp includes registry directly\n- All polymorphic tests consolidated in gtest_polymorphic_ports.cpp\n\nCo-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
